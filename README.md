# Occupancy-detection-data

This repository hosts the experimental measurements for the occupancy detection tasks.
It includes a clear description of the data files.

* Description of the data columns(units etc).
* The scripts to reproduce exploratory figures.
* The scripts for model training.
* The commands for model testing.
* Also note that when training  and testing the models you have to use the seed command to ensure reproducibility. 
* There may be small variations in the reported accuracy.

This is a repository for data for the publication:

**Accurate occupancy detection of an office room from light, temperature, humidity and CO2 measurements using statistical learning models.** 
  *Luis M. Candanedo, VÃ©ronique Feldheim* **Energy and Buildings** **-In press-**


Follow the commented lines in the model development file. Install all the packages dependencies before trying to train and test the models.

Please do not forget to cite the publication! Thanks!
